# Example routing basic

Start the project running the command:

```
make
```

You can create an route by creating a new file inside the folder `pages`.

Each file will be a route, following its pattern of folders.

In this example we created 3 routes.

- `index.jsx`: /
- `route-at-root.jsx`: /route-at-root
- `level/route-at-level.jsx`: /level/route-at-level
