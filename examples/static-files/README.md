# Example static files

Start the project running the command:

```
make
```

To serve static files, you will need to create a folder called `public`. Every
asset inside this folder will be available.

In this example we have an `image.png` inside the folder `public`. You can see
the image at `localhost:8080/image.png`.

This also works on the folder name, and you can receive that value as well.
