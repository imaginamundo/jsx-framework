# Example routing variable

You can create an route with an variable by creating a file that starts with the character `:`. The text that is inserted after the `:` will be the variable name that you can use inside your file.

In this example a route `/*` (`*` can be anything).

This also works on the folder name, and you can receive that value as well.
